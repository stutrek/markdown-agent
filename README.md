# Markdown Agent

**Markdown Agent** is a simple way to create and run AI agents using plain Markdown files. You write your agentâ€™s behavior in everyday English (with some optional configuration in YAML), run it from the command line, and the results are saved as an HTML file.  

It comes with a set of built-in tools for fetching URLs, reading RSS feeds, and loading local files. You can also extend it with your own tools in Node.js.

AI calls are handled by [Ollama](https://ollama.com). Models and settings are controlled via YAML blocks in your Markdown agent.

## Installation

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (use any method you prefer).  
2. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and download at least one model (follow their instructions).  
3. Install Markdown Agent globally:  

```bash
npm install -g mdagent
```

## Quick Start Example

Create a file called `my-agent.md`:

```md
# System

```yaml
model: gpt-oss:20b
tools:
  - fetchRss
\``` <-- remove the backslash

You are an editor that finds interesting articles to read. Today is {{CURRENT_DATE}}.

# Find topics

Load yesterday's RSS articles from `https://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index` and pick two quirky, unique articles. Print their titles and URLs.
```

Run the agent:

```bash
mdagent my-agent.md
```

This will create a new HTML file in the `output` directory containing the full conversation and results.

## Writing Markdown Agents

A Markdown agent is just a Markdown file with sections. The two main sections are:

1. **System section** (`# System`) â€“ sets the agentâ€™s role, model, and configuration.  
2. **User sections** (`# Something`) â€“ instructions for the agent, written in plain English.  

Each additional `# Header` is run in order, with the output of one section passed into the next. When finished, the full run is saved as an HTML file in the `output` directory.

## Configuration

Configuration is written inside YAML blocks at the top of a section. For example:

```yaml
model: gpt-oss:20b
think: medium

# Advanced Ollama options (example: requires 16GB free memory)
seed: 42
num_ctx: 65536
num_predict: 16384
top_k: 40
top_p: 0.9

# Pass arguments to your agent from the CLI
# Example: mdagent my-agent.md --date 2025-09-15 --section tech
input:
  - date
  - section

# Tools available to this agent
tools:
  - fetchRss
  - fetchUrls
  - loadFile
```

## Built-in Tools

- **fetchUrls** â€“ fetches one or more webpages. Converts HTML to Markdown. Supports options for selecting which parts to keep or remove with CSS selectors.  
- **fetchRss** â€“ fetches an RSS feed, with optional filtering by date.  
- **loadFile** â€“ loads the content of a local file into the agentâ€™s context. Files must be in the same directory (or a sibling folder) as your Markdown file.  

## Custom Tools

You can extend Markdown Agent with your own tools in Node.js. A custom tool has:

- **A name** â€“ how the agent refers to it.  
- **A description** â€“ tells the AI when it should use this tool.  
- **An input schema** â€“ defined with [Zod](https://zod.dev/).  
- **An `execute` function** â€“ the code that actually runs when the tool is called.  

This makes it possible to add custom logic, fetch data from APIs, or even call other models.
